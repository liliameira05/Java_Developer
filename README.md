  If you do not close the scanner class it will generate warnings like Resource leak.
  
  Resource leak happens when a program doesn’t release the resources it has acquired. As OS have limit on the no of sockets, file handle, database conn etc thus its extremely important to manage these non-memory resources explicitly. So we explicitly call close() methods to free up resources.
  
  NOTE : Garbage collection in java can only mange memory resources.Non-memory system memory resources need to be handled explicitly by programmer.
